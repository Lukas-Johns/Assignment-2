    <p class="center"><strong>History:</strong><br>Born in Kyoto, a city in Japan, Gunpei spent the majority of his life working for nintendo. At the time of his arrival nintendo wasn't a video game company, but instead made playing cards. Some believe that Gunpei was the one who wanted to turn nintendo into what it is today. This is because he was the first person to introduce games into the company. This started when the nintendo president saw Gunpei making a toy on his own time. This was soon released into production to be known as the "ultra hand." This lead to other lines of brilliant products, some over which mentioned above in "achomplishments." One notable invention, the "virtual boy," was the first ever vr game consle. Gunpei slowly passed away during a traffic accident, but hopefully his achomplishments wont be forgotten.</p>
